		<h1>Maintenance Notice - 1 October 2008</h1>
		<p>
			Jira is currently down for maintenance.  It is anticipated that it will be unavailable for the rest of the day.
		</p>
		<p>
			The maintenance work is to relocate the Jira installation to a new server, after which time this URL will be defunct.  Users will be advised of the new URL when it is activated.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the interim, could any <em>urgent</em> issues please be emailed directly to me at adam.cameron@pixl8.co.uk, however any normal Jira traffic should be reserved until the system is back up.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apologies for any inconvenience caused.
		</p>
		<p>
			Adam
