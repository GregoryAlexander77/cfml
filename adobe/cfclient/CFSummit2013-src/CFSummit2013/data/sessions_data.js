He'll address such things as changes regarding web servers (the 'internal' web server, now Tomcat's, and changes in external web server integration); config tweaks people have done in JRun and whether/how those are to be done on Tomcat; some things about native Tomcat don't apply to Tomcat as run under CF; as well as logging, configuration, and other matters.
